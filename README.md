# On Time Manufacturing Prediction

## Purpose
This project was performed in an attempt to predict on-time productions. There are multiple components, but the primary concern is to predict on-time or late completion.

## Tools
The project was done with r and rStudio to make use of rMarkdown features. In addition, many libraries from the tidyverse were used. There were also some libraries used for machine learning, namely random forests and deep learning.

## Outcome
The model produced was insufficient for predicting on-time completion as the datasets were unable to be processed as intended. This is likely due to the use of r packages and techniques that I was unfamiliar with at the time. With Python based tools this project would have been far easier, but r was the tool of the time.
